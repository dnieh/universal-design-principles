## <a name="8020">80/20 Rule</a>
80% of x involves 20% of y
#### Example
A toolbar that takes up little space but provides a bunch of functionality. 

## <a name="accessibility">Accessibility</a>
Environments should be accessible to as many users as possible without modification. There are 4 traits that indicate this:  perceptibility, operability, simplicity, and forgiveness.
#### Example
Web forms with placeholder text and aria attributes.

## <a name="advance-organizer">Advance Organizer</a>
Instructional technique that explains new things using existing knowledge. Two types: expository and comparative.
#### Example
Tree chart do depict someone's ancestry (expository).

## <a name="aesthetic-usability-effect">Aesthetic-Usability Effect</a>
People like to use and prefer pretty things.
#### Example
Pretty things.

## <a name="affordance">Affordance</a>
Where physical characteristics of an object match/influence its function
#### Example
Plate on door meant to be pushed vs handle meant to be pulled.

## <a name="alignment">Alignment</a>
Placement of elements so that the edges line up along a line. Could also be a line through the vertical center.
#### Example
Any word document.

## <a name="anthropomorphic-form">Anthropomorphic Form</a>
A tendency to favor humanoid looking things.
#### Example
Pear shaped method soap dispenser.

## <a name="archetypes">Archetypes</a>
Universal patterns derived from innate biases.
#### Example
Foreboding architecture surrounding nuclear disposal sites to warn future intelligence.

## <a name="area-alignment">Area Alignment</a>
Aligning elements based on the density of their area and not just their edges.
#### Example
Vertical silhouettes of people.

## <a name="attractiveness-bias">Attractiveness Bias</a>
Tendecy to perceive attractive people as smarter, more moral, sociable, and competent.
#### Example

Tendency to see people and things with baby faces as more naive, helpless, and honest.
#### Example
People almost universally adore babies. However, the same can not be said about your average adult male.

## <a name="biophilia-effect">Biophilia Effect</a>
Environments rich in nature views reduce stress and increase focus and concentration.
#### Example
Go camping.

## <a name="cathedral-effect">Cathedral Effect</a>
Relation between perceived height of a ceiling and cognition. High ceilings -> creativity. Low ceilings -> concrete,
detail-oriented.

## <a name="chunking">Chunking</a>
Combining many units of info into limited units (chunks).
#### Example
